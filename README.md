# Axiamatic

This is an exercise I did while interviewing with Axiamatic.

## Goal

Using ReactJS your exercise is to implement a responsive Product Selection Page as close to the design below

## Summary

The Axiamatic onboarding flow allows a team leader to sign-up and register his team and select the products to collect feedback from his team. The exercise is specific to the implementation of the Product Selection page.

## Tasks

1. Build the page a close to the design
2. Build the search bar with a list of products displayed (see Step 1 below). The data for the search bar could be locally stored (not on the browser)
3. Allow products to be added to the four selection boxes (See Step 2 below).
4. Save the products to the backend when Next button is selected (See Step 2 below)
